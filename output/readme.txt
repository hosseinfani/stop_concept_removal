This folder contains the output stoplist of baseline methods base on two approach: 
- Threshold-based: if a concept has a score of being stopconcept greater than a threshold
- Topk% of concepts that have highest score for being stopconcept

Sample stoplists have been pushed for threshold-based and topk% approaches for 0.0 (i.e., empty list), 0.1, 0.2. We did up until 0.9, 1.0.
